Thymeleaf Eclipse Plugin
========================

A plugin for the Eclipse IDE to add auto-completion support for the Thymeleaf
standard dialect processors in the Eclipse Web Tools Platform HTML source
editor.

 - Current version: 0.1.0
 - Released: (none yet)


Requirements
------------

 - Java 7
 - Eclipse Juno SR1 (4.2.1) w/ Eclipse Web Tools Platform 3.4.1

The above is what I have developed and tested the plugin against, so can't
confirm it will work with other configurations.  I'll relax the requirements
once I create a plugin that actually, you know, _works_ :)
